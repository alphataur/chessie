JavaScript implementation of a basic chess engine to spend time if you are a loner like me :) !


---

The initial idea behind this repo is to create a chess engine using minmax and alpha beta pruning and then I might wanna implement a neural network to handle move recommendations


### TODO:

- [ ] Automoves for both players
- [ ] save state
- [ ] automoves configurations
- [ ] initial game engine
